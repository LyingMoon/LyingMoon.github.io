I am a second year master student at Stanford University, Department of Mechanical Engineering (ME). I have a wide interest in robotics, control, embodied AI and autonomous driving. My current focus lies in developing scalable robot learning systems, combining deep generative modeling and reinforcement learning to enable robust manipulation in complex environments. Recently, I have worked on vision-language-action (VLA) models and diffusion policy for robotic manipulation, model training and evaluation, robust multi-agent trajectory prediction on large-scale datasets such as nuPlan, and navigation frameworks for multi-robot systems using 3D reconstuction via gaussian splatting.

Before coming to Stanford, I earned my bachelor's degree from University of Pittsburgh, where I concentrated on Mechatronics/Control Systems/Machine learning and minored in Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to receive guidance from Prof. [Nikhil Bajaj](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/people/faculty/nikhil-bajaj). I gained hands-on experiences on embedded systems and data-driven control through projects involving moblie robot autonomy and hardware-software integration.

Out of study, I enjoying traveling, biking and listening to music. I love <span style="background-color: #ff8c00; color: white; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">Frank Ocean</span> songs and I collect vinyl records. I also played League before and reached Master rank but haven't played for quiet a while.

This past summer, I worked at Tetheria.AI as a Robotics Software Engineer Intern, where I gained invaluable hands-on experience and learning opportunities. I am excited to continue exploring opportunities in the robotics industry.
